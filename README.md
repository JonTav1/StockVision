# StockVision

StockVision is an application that allows users to store, check, and delete stocks in their stock portfolios.

Users can also receive an ai-generated sentiment on the stock based on price data, and widely used trading indicators.

StockVision also provides basic charting abilities, so you can visualize your stocks.

Technologies: Go Backend, React.js Frontend. Initially the application was deployed locally with a MySQL database, but eventually ported to AWS.
AWS Amplify was used for the frontend, while I used API Gateway pointing to different Lambda function endpoints. 
DynamoDB was used to store user credentials and stock portfolio data.
